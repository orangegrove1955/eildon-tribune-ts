Goulburn-Murray Water is continuing to warn the public to avoid contact with water in Lake Eildon due to high levels of blue-green algae.

The warning was issued in June 2010 and applies to all locations of Lake Eildon.\
Lake Eildon includes the Main Arm near Eildon Township, Goughs Bay, Jamieson, Delatite and Bonnie Doon.\
It also applies to shallow and deep parts of the Lake.

Blue-green algae are very small and are present across the entire lake even when there is no obvious change to the colour of water.\
There are certainly areas of Lake Eildon where there are visible signs of blue-green algae, however this does not mean the areas that appear clear are safe.

Visitors to Lake Eildon can still sightsee and enjoy other activities that do not involve direct contact with the water.

It is recommended that GMW customers seek alternative supplies.
