Victoria's wild weather has moved to the east of the state, where heavy rain is causing flooding.

A severe thunderstorm warning is in place for the north-eastern, Alpine and East Gippsland forecast districts.

The weather bureau has also issued minor flood warnings for Buffalo River and the Buckland River.

Tim Wiebusch from the SES says locals need to stay away from creeks and rivers in the area.

"At this stage the major flood height at Lake Buffalo is five metres and the river has already raised itself to 5.2 metres, and we're expecting that to continue to increase in the short term," he said.

Mr Wiebusch says people need to do what they can to avoid the coming floodwater.

"We're warning particularly campers at this time to move to higher ground and not to be camping alongside any river systems in the north-east of the state, as heavy rainfall is starting to see significant stream rises," he said.

"We're also advising people on roads not to try to navigate their way through flood waters."

Overnight, up to 100 millimetres of rain fell across some parts of Victoria. The SES received more than 100 calls for help.

Two hotels and a nursing home near Alexandra, north-east of Melbourne, were inundated with water.

Weather bureau senior forecaster Phil King says there has been some flash flooding in the Gisborne area.

"There were some very heavy storms with falls of up to 60 millimetres around the Gisborne area, and also later on through Eildon," he said.

"Now the heaviest falls have moved to the east and north-east of Victoria, and we're seeing large amounts of rain fall into the catchments up through the north-east."

Mr King says the heaviest of the falls missed the Melbourne area.
