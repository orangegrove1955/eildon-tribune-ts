The new millennium has kicked off with a bang for law enforcement officers, with a group of five teens found at the site of infamous Camp Eildon Lake. One of the group has survived, though remains in a coma, while the remaining four were found dead on the scene. The reason why they were at the forbidden campground is not entirely certain, but there is evidence supporting the theory the group was having a New Years Eve party to celebrate the end of the millennium.

Their bodies were spotted early this morning on the shorefront of the former campgrounds by a fisherman. Afraid of the legends of the area, the fisherman did not attempt to investigate himself, instead heading directly to the police station and alerting officials.

“No way, no how was I going over there,” the fisherman told this reporter. “I know the stories about Henry Miller, I’ve heard he never really died, not his spirit anyway.” This statement reflects the fear and concern that has been building in recent years regarding the campground, and its history of brutality.

Senior Constable Loomis of the Eildon Police Force flatly denies these concerns. “These are nothing but stories, figments of the imagination,” he says regarding the numerous sightings of Miller in the past 9 years. “There’s no way Miller could still be at the camp, we found his body. We know it was him, and everyone who’s claiming to see him is nothing but a drunk or a liar.”

The dead bodies were found to be missing both their hearts and eyes, though the *Tribune* has no information as to the reason why these organs were missing. The boy in a coma, who at this stage remains unidentified, still has heart and eyes intact, though there are numerous wounds to his body, indicating the killer may have been scared off before being able to complete his act.

This latest set of murders does not bode well for the Senior Constable’s statements, as the group was found to have been murdered by axe. This is the same weapon as both Miller's original psychotic episode, as well as the tragic deaths of four family members of victims at the five year anniversary in 1996.

With an increasing body count, and growing frustration from the community, this latest incident is sure to spark renewed interest in the case throughout the beginning of these 2000s. Regardless of whether Henry Miller’s spirit remains at the camp, it is clear there is something seriously wrong with the campgrounds of Camp Eildon Lake.
