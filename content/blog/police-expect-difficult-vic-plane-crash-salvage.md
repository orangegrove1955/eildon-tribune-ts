Victorian police say it could be several days before they retrieve the wreckage of the plane that crashed into Lake Eildon yesterday.

On board were the 35-year-old pilot, a 43-year-old man, an 8-year-old girl and a 42-year-old woman whose body was retrieved yesterday.

The victims are all from Melbourne's eastern suburbs but their names have not been released.

Their relatives have been notified and some have arrived at Lake Eildon to inspect the scene.

The single engine, Piper aircraft crashed into the water after it clipped powerlines that cross the Lake not far from Eildon weir.

Acting Sergeant James Bate from Search and Rescue says there is zero visibility in the lake.

"This is a complex and hazardous diving operation, it takes alot of preparation to be able to successfully execute," he said.

"Just because we have divers in the water, there's no guarantee we'll actually find anything straight away."

Police divers using sonar equipment will continue the search for the others tomorrow.

The plane was on a flight from Wallan to Wangaratta when it went down.
