More concerns are being raised today about the new national bushfire building standard which was adopted by Victoria and the ACT last month.

Last week the CSIRO told AM that it believes the new standard offers less protection for residents in bushfire-prone areas than the last standard.

The peak body representing Australasia's fire emergency agencies, AFAC, supports the CSIRO in its criticisms.

And it is also questioning the process for developing the new code, which saw the leading scientific and safety groups out-voted on the standards committee by the building industry.

The new national bushfire building standard was quickly adopted by Victoria and the ACT after the Black Saturday fires.

The other states and territories must introduce it by May next year.

The nation's leading scientific organisation, the CSIRO believes the new standard removes or weakens some crucial material and design requirements.

Like the CSIRO, the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council (AFAC) was on the 17-member Standards Australia Committee that debated the standard for eight years.

It also voted against the adoption of the new standard last month.

AFAC chief executive officer Naomi Brown says her organisation shares the CSIRO's concerns.

And Ms Brown is also worried about the way the new standard deals with homes being built in the highest risk bushfire areas known as the flame zone.

"We believe that each of the applications should be individually assessed, and probably individually designed. And we think that the new standard is not adequate in that area," she said.

She said when there is a vote on standards, the ballot passes with a majority vote.

"I think a majority is perhaps not always good enough when it comes to the standards."

"We think that both our representatives on this standard, along with the CSIRO, really have got something serious to say, both about the science behind it and of the safety, and possibly should have some more consideration, or some reconsideration," she said.

Naomi Brown says that AFAC and the CSIRO have very different views to the building industry groups which form the majority of the standards committee.

"There's this ongoing tension between development, between safety, land clearing, cost - all those things."

"You're always looking for a balance, and this is one of those situations where we feel it didn't come out on the side of safety as much as it should." she said.
