There are fears the bushfires could have a serious long-term impact on Victoria's water quality.

Dr Patrick Lane from Melbourne University says the destruction of vegetation could lead to more sediment and debris flowing into water catchments.

There is also a risk of flooding in fire-affected areas.

Dr Lane says the next six months will be critical.

"Actually getting something to grow in those first few months after a fire, particularly when we've got very low rainfall is pretty hard to get the protection in place that you would really like," he said.

"The best thing you can have is vegetation, particularly near streams, but it's very hard to get vegetation growing very quickly."
