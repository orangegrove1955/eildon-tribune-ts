Four children and a woman have been taken to hospital after fire destroyed a houseboat on Lake Eildon in Victoria's north-east.

Police said the boat was moored at the Eildon Boat Club at Anderson Harbour when the fire started, possibly due to a gas leak.

About 12 children and three adults were onboard when the fire broke on Tuesday about 10:30am (AEDT).

Paramedics said it was a chaotic scene, with bystanders helping the injured passengers when they arrived.

They treated 12 people, mainly children, with four taken to the Alexandra Hospital, including a primary school aged boy with a potential spinal injury, a teenage girl with burns and a woman, aged in her 40s, with minor breathing problems.

The Country Fire Authority said the burning boat was towed out into the water after a nearby boat was damaged by radiant heat.

The fire is not being treated as suspicious.

It is the 12th boat fire this year.

Paul Corkill from Maritime Safety Victoria said there had been a concerning rise in the number of boat fires each year.

"Most fires are caused by the release of fuel vapours that congregate in confined spaces and those are then ignited by electrical," he said.

"Our message has been to really encourage boat owners to make sure their boats are properly maintained and checked out by reputable people."
