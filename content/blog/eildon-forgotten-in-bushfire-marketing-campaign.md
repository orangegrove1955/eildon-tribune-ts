Tourism operators at Lake Eildon in northern Victoria are hoping for an influx of visitors during the Easter long weekend to keep them going.

The area is in the Murrundindi shire that was badly affected by the Black Saturday fires.

The coordinator of the Eildon Visitor Information Centre, Don Hewitt says the town itself was not burnt in the fires.

But there is a perception it was and local businesses are suffering.

"We just found that people just stopped coming, it was like a ghost town here for at least two weeks after the fire stopped.

Mr Hewitt says Lake Eildon has been left out of a state wide marketing campaign, to attract visitors.

"We seem to have been forgotten when it comes to promoting tourism across the whole area," he said.

"It seems to jump from Yarra Valley in the ranges to Beechworth and we have just been continually left out which is very frustrating for the local tourism operators."

He said visitor numbers are still down and they hope that people will return to the area over the Easter break.
