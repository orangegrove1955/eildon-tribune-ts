description: Nothing much has changed on local rivers. Fish mornings in classic
  summer water–riffles and fast slots. The North Fork Clearwater and Kelly Creek
  are good summer options. Dries, with or without a dropper, will find biters.
  Goldens, Pmds, caddis, and Yellow Sallies are all on the menu. The Lochsa and
  Selway rivers have been fishing pretty well for cutthroat and rainbow trout.
  Looking for colder water? Try the Kootenai River

Judging by the number of evening rises, fly fishermen should do well at Fishtrap Lake. It might also be worth checking out other put-and-take lakes south of Spokane. For catch-and-release fishing, tiny Starvation and Bayley lakes southeast of Colville have pretty decent rainbow trout fishing. Although the catching has slowed down in the hot weather, mornings and evenings are still a good bet.

If you’re headed to Montana, check out the hoot-owl restrictions at https://fwp.mt.gov/news/current-closures-restrictions/waterbody-closures, as more restrictions went into effect Wednesday, including full fishing closures on the entire Jefferson and Madison rivers and portions of the Big Hole, Gallatin Beaverhead, Missouri, Yellowstone and Stillwater rivers. “Hoot-owl” restrictions prevent fishing from 2 p.m. to midnight.

Some big catches of nice-sized Loon Lake perch have been reported recently, most coming from about 25 feet of water off the weed beds along the east side. The bite is pretty much an all-day affair. Fan, Diamond, and Sacheen lakes all have been booting out nice largemouth as well as perch and some crappie.
