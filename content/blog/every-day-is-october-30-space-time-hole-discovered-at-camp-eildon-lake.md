# **BREAKING NEWS**

In a shocking discovery, a team of local physicists working investigating gravitational forces noticed a strange spike in the area around Camp Eildon Lake. After further investigation, the scientists have announced they have found a "blip in the fabric of reality", forming a massive loop in the space-time continuum. 

The team denies this loop in space-time has anything to do with the infamous killings at the lakeside camp, but do admit they cannot explain the origin of the loop. Camp Eildon Lake, best known for its ongoing series of strange occurrences, has often been associated with some mystical force of evil. With this new discovery, however, some are theorising the mystical force may be linked to a physical one.

"Gravity plays a strange role in time," says physicist Michael Vorhees, 'the presence of a massive gravitational spike means that time flows differently in the area."

When asked about how this gravitational spike affected the timeline, Vorhees mentioned it may mean "every day is October 30" also adding that "in our estimation, this means every night is the night before Halloween."

While the scientific investigation is ongoing, details continue to emerge that support Vorhees suggestion. The weather in the area does not seem to follow the seasons, the wildlife in the area acts strangely when around the gravitational spike, and an ominous sense of evil spirits seems to constantly be present.
