Police divers are preparing to search for victims of a light plane crash at Lake Eildon, north-east of Melbourne.

The body of a woman has been recovered but police believe another three people were on board the plane travelling to the state's north.

The plane crashed into the lake yesterday after clipping power lines that cross Lake Eildon near the dam wall.

The accident site has been marked by buoys less than 100 metres from the power lines.

Two men and a primary school-aged girl remain missing.

Their identities have not been released.

This afternoon police divers will establish decompression chambers at the scene to enable them to commence searching depths of up to 40 metres tomorrow morning.

Acting Sergeant James Bate says the job is a dangerous and complicated one because of snags, the likely spread of debris and complete lack of visibility.

"We also have cold water, torn metal, hydraulic fluid and aviation fuel in the water," he said.

The plane was on a flight from Wallan to Wangaratta when it went down.
