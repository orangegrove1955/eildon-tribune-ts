More than 50 years after first giving blood, CFA volunteer Bob Goninon has now donated close to 600 litres of blood, enough to fill a tanker.

Individuals can only donate plasma and platelets every fortnight and blood every 12 weeks.

And it has taken Mr Goninon, of Alexandra, 51 years to complete 700 donations of blood and plasma, making him just one of seven Victorians to achieve the milestone.

"Originally I had a personal problem where on a regular basis I would have nosebleeds that would run for anywhere up to three hours," he said.

"One particular day, one just didn't want to abate, and I was going through towels and an ambulance was called and I was taken to St Vincent's Hospital … where a doctor could start plugging my nose.

> "At the end of that process he strongly advised that I bottled this product, preferably not straight from my nose, so the blood bank is where I went."

## Helping others in need

He said although donating blood helped stem the nosebleeds for quite some time, his decision to continue donating decades on had become more about helping others.

"I think any emergency services worker will agree that from time to time you see a lot of situations such as road trauma, house fires, emergency in the home, cancer patients — all of these people who unfortunately during a certain time in their life require blood," he said.

"And the only way that they can get that product to enhance their quality of life is via a donor."

According to the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood, one in every three Australians will need blood or blood products in their lifetime.

However only one in 30 Australians donate blood each year.

"We need more donors, I'm not getting any younger, so we need the younger brigade to start stepping up," Mr Goninon said.

Mr Goninon is one of seven Victorians to have reached the milestone of 700 blood and plasma donations.

## Plenty has changed in 50 years

Since making his first donation in August 1970, he said much had changed about the process.

"Originally you were given a bit of anaesthetic in your arm which kind of deadened your arm a little bit to make it easier for the withdrawal," he said.

"That was of course for whole blood, but then I started donating plasma when they started doing that.

"The centrifuge used to separate the blood components was bigger than a Volkswagen, and you sat in a chair for up to four hours."

He said while the centrifuge was not loud, it had been intimidating, taking up at a large part of the room.

"It did what it had to do, but nowadays the machine is quite small, and it just sits beside you when you're in the chair at the donor centre," he said.

These days, the process itself takes only 45 minutes, although a 1.5-hour appointment is recommended.

## 'Roll up your sleeve'

Despite preparing to make his 703th donation this Thursday, Mr Goninon said it was not about achieving milestones, but about doing his bit for the community.

He called on his fellow CFA members to take part in this year's annual Emergency Services Blood Challenge, which began on June 1.

The challenge encourages friendly competition between emergency service workers to donate and help save lives.

"I'd encourage all CFA volunteers out there that are fit and well to pop into a donor centre and roll up your sleeve for the cause," he said.
