An 18-year-old girl who died after being thrown from a boat is being farewelled at Lilydale, in Melbourne's east today.

Casey Hardman of Ringwood North was a passenger in the boat on Lake Eildon, when it hit a tree in the dark eight days ago.

A 16-year-old boy has been charged with manslaughter.

It comes as the state's water police launch their annual summer crackdown on marine safety.

Acting Senior Sergeant Greg Barras says the focus will be on speeding, alcohol and safety equipment.

"Life jackets and flares, devices to be able to bale your bucket out if you're sinking, fire extinguishers and other pieces of equipment must be carried on vessels at all times depending on the area of operation," he said.

Last year the water police responded to more than 1240 incidents.

January is traditionally the busiest month of the year.

Police will be targeting areas such as Queenscliff, Geelong and Lake Eildon.

Boat operators are also being warned about being breath-tested.
