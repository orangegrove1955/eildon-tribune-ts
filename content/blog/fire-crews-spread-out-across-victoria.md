Backburning and containment work is continuing at four major bushfires still burning across Victoria.

Extra firefighters are being brought in to protect Victorian towns that could be threatened if dangerous weather conditions arrive tomorrow.

Emergency Services Commissioner Bruce Esplin says strong northerly winds and temperatures into the high-30s are likely to test firefighters.

"We have existing fires and I think that's a challenge," he said.

"The fires that are burning, the winds, the lightning and the state of fuel that exists around the whole of Victoria is a cause for real concern. There is no place for complacency tomorrow."

The Department of Sustainability and Environment's (DSE) spokesman, Stuart Ord, says crews are concentrating on vulnerable areas.

"That can either mean on the fire edge where we were a bit more concerned about whether it'll jump or not, or moving resources into small communities to protect them if the fire makes a run tomorrow," he said.

"Strategy-wise it's that thinking about best places to be, and doing as much as we possibly can before the winds pick up tomorrow."

He says authorities will spend the day making sure equipment is in the right spots.

"That both our machinery, our helicopters, making sure that they're based appropriately by the end of the day, and making sure that the priority townships and settlements have firefighters in them, have machinery in them to help us protect them tomorrow," he said.
